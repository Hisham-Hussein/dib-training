Description
-----------

This half day workshop will introduce biologists to `Project
Jupyter <http://jupyter.org/>`__ (formerly IPython Notebook).  We will 
assume some minimal experience with Python, but people new to IPython 
Notebook/Project Jupyter are welcome to attend!

Project Jupyter is a literate data analysis environment (similar to
knitr and Shiny) that supports over 40 different programming
languages, including R and Python both.  It can be used to build
reproducible analyses for publication, collaborate over distances on
data analysis, and build interactive tutorials and homeworks around
data analysis.
