=================================================
So You Want to (or Need to) Create an AWS Account
=================================================

This page will take you through the creating of an Amazon Web Services account.
In addition to a computer, you'll need a phone to receive a call, and a credit 
card to charge for computing costs. (Generally this is meager, less than $5 
for a workshop).

Go to `http://aws.amazon.com/ <http://aws.amazon.com/>`__, and click on "Create an AWS account".
You'll notice that there are two buttons that say this, make sure you choose the correct one or 
nothing will work. (Just kidding, they are both the same. Not sure why Amazon made two).

it on your phone keypad.
