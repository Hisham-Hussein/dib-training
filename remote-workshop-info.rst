Local + Remote Workshop Guidelines
==================================

**What it is:** A 3 hour lesson taught at a location which is then broadcast
to remote locations and also streamed to YouTube using Goolge Hangouts on Air.
The video and lesson materials will remain online indefinitely for future use.

**What this document is:** A description of the roles of people involved, materials, 
lesson timeline, used as well as examples of past lessons, and frequently asked questions.

Guidelines
----------

**People involved:** 

- **Instructor:** responsible for teaching (using screen sharing on google hangouts), need to have solid draft of teaching materials two weeks in advance


- **Helpers:** Go over teaching material in advance to be able to help with questions, act as helpers in normal *Carp fashion. One helper at teaching location should be in charge of monitoring Etherpad for questions and answering them directly on the Etherpad (if they are simple) or relaying them to the instructor and typing the answer in the Etherpad.

- **Room Leader:** At each location, one person should be in charge of making sure the technology is working. This is generally the person hosting the Google Hangout connection.

**Materials used:**
 
- etherpad chat used for questions, students should be told that they can ask questions in chat (if they prefer that over raising hand and asking)

- all local sites should have sticky notes in two colors, and use them to monitor room progress like Software Carpentry does (green = all good, red = help!)

**Lesson timeline:**

*Before Workshop:*

- 2 weeks before workshop, have instructor send out teaching materials, helpers go over materials, collect phone numbers from one person from each site

- 1 week before, do tech test. Google hangout on air streaming to youtube. Verify everything works. (see: https://github.com/dib-lab/dib-training-private/blob/master/remote-tech-test-checklist.txt)

- 2-3 days before, send out workshop reminder email with location details, install instructions, and survey (sample questions here: https://github.com/dib-lab/dib-training-private/blob/master/survey-questions.txt)

*Day of workshop:*

- 10-15 minutes before lesson start, create Google Hangout on Air (instructions in tech-test-checklist.txt doc linked above), make sure it streams to youtube, have everyone join, keep remote mics muted.

- for first 5-10 minutes, locally do introductions of helpers/room leader. Explain that workshop is being taught remotely on google hangouts, mention that remote mics are muted, so they should feel free to ask questions, show online teaching materials, show etherpad, explain etherpad chat is  where they can ask questions at any time, explain video will up on youtube (and time stamped) so it can be referred to later, explain stickies

- lesson starts, instructor teachers until first challenge question. Presents challenge question, people work, when they are done (for the most part), helpers go over challenge question locally, when all sites are finished, lesson starts up again. Repeat this each time there is a challenge question.

- halfway through, break for coffee for 10-15 minutes

- finish teaching (repeating challenge question protocol each time one arises)

- day of workshop, send out survey (to maximize survey response), include link to youtube video, say it will be time stamped, include general DIB training info (website, signing up for mailing list, adding google cal)

- within a few days after workshop, go through and add time stamps to youtube video.

NOTE: instructors should (be reminded to) repeat questions that are asked locally :)

Frequently Asked Questions
---------------------------

1. Do I, as a participant, need to register if I am not attending a workshop, only watching from home?

No, you only need to register if you will be attending our workshop in a classroom.

2. Do I, as a remote instructor, need to host a learning site?

We strongly recommend that you do host a site, even if it is only a few people. This will allow you to observe how students are doing with the material, which is not possible if you are only teaching to your computer screen.

3. How do I, as an instructor, keep track of the etherpad, gitter, and teaching?

As an instructor, you will be sharing your screen to Google Hangouts on Air, so you will not be able to keep track of other screens. Use your helpers! Insert Emily's advice here.

4. Do I need to create a Google Hangout?

No, UC Davis will do all the tech stuff.

5. Who do I ask about questions?

Helpful hints for the instructor
-------------------------------

* Make use of the Software Carpentry sticky note system, explain this before the workshop.
* Designate one local helper to be in charge of monitoring the Etherpad for questions posted by students. Answer questions when possible, and make sure the lecturer is notified of questions that can be addressed to them. Additionally, type the answers to the questions in the Etherpad for reference for everyone. (This is *very* appreciated by students!)
* Include remote locations by asking them what they got as answers for challenge questions
* Go slow at first when introducing new software (such as R) and moving files into the correct location.
