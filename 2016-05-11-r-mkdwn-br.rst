Description
-----------

This 3 hour workshop will introduce scientists to creating dynamic documents with RMarkdown and Knitr.  Dynamic documents contain both program code and narratives and are useful for writing reproducible analysis reports for publication, sharing work with collaborators, writing up homework, and keeping a bioinformatic notebook.  Rmarkdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring dynamic HTML, PDF, Microsoft Word, Markdown and presentation files.  

In this workshop we will go over the basis of knitr code chunk syntax and options, inline code, plotting, tables, caching, 
​and ​inserting bibliographies.  We will focus on rendering HTML files, however, resources for rendering other document types will be provided.   

We will assume some experience with R and RStudio, however, people who are new to Rmarkdown and knitr are welcome to attend the workshop.

This workshop will be taught remotely and broadcast to our classroom
via Google Hangouts on Air. We will have helpers in our local room to
facilitate the lesson. The lesson will also be streamed to YouTube and
saved there for viewing at a later time. **You only need to register to
this event if you plan on coming to a classroom.**
