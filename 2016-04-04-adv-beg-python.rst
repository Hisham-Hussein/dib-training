Description
-----------

This half day workshop will introduce biologists to working in Python
3.  Python is a very powerful language for scientific computing and
this workshop will give you some exposure to it.  We will be covering
the basics, including fundamental concepts such as loops, creating
functions, and debugging.  Some experience working with a scripting
language (e.g. R or Python) is recommended but not necessary.

Topics overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Loops and functions
* Data analysis using python
* Troubleshooting

.. The materials for this workshop are available indefinitely
.. `here <http://2015-mar-semimodel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__.


Computer and workshop requirements
----------------------------------

Attendees will need to bring a computer with an Internet connection.

Please install Python 3.x before the workshop by following the
instructions below.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

`Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ is a very powerful programming
language.  For this workshop, we will be working with Python 3.  In
order to avoid downloading all of its scientific packages
individually, we will use `Anaconda
<https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda>`__ as an all-in-one installer.

Windows:

1. Go to `https://www.continuum.io/downloads <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`__.
2. Download Python 3.x (3.4 is fine) 64-bit graphical installer for Windows, *not* Python 2.7.
3. Install Python 3.x using all defaults *except* make sure to check **Make Anaconda the default Python**.

OS X:

1. Go to `https://www.continuum.io/downloads <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`__.
2. Download Python 3.x (3.4 is fine) 64-bit graphical installer for OS X, *not* Python 2.7.
3. Install Python 3.x using all defaults.

Once installation is complete, please go to `this page
<http://bids.github.io/2016-01-14-berkeley/setup/index.html>`__ to
test that Python has installed correctly.  If you do not have bash
installed, please refer to the installation instructions at the bottom
of `this page
<http://dib-training.readthedocs.org/en/pub/2015-12-03-shell-halfday.html>`__.

Please come a bit early if you have trouble with installation.
